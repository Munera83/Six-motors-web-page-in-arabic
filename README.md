# Six motors web page in Arabic
A web page with 6 sliders connected with a database to control a robotic arm <br>
**1-Languages**<br>
The web page has built with HTML, CSS, javascript, and PHP.<br>
**2-Database**<br>
The database contains one table with 8 columns (ID, Motor1, Motor2, Motor3, Motor4, Motor5, Motor6, onoff).<br>
It must be initiated  with one row where the id=1 and onoff=1-9/0 (0 means off).<br>
In the future, the program will stick to 0 for off and 1 for on.<br>
The web page will automatically take the values of the motors from the database and initiate  the 6 sliders with them.<br>
When you click تشغيل/إطفاء button without clicking حفظ button, it will not update the database with the inputted  values.<br>
<br>
**3-Buttons**<br>
When you click any button, the page will reload.
<br>
**4-Background**<br>
I attached the background photo I used for a better UI.
